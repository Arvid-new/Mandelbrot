# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot set / Juslia set viewer

hello unknown stranger, this is my Mandelbrot set viewer. Hope you will like it. I dont know what to write here :)

# Tutorial


	Main screen: 

		Buttons:

			Add iterations: add one iteration of loop of drawing the image.

			Reset: Set everything to how it is at the beginning.

			Zoom out: zooms out back (if you zoomed).

			Change main color: change main color which is used in some coloring modes.

			Add 20 iterations: adds 20 more iterations.

			Change options for Julia set: changes numbers from witch is a Julia set generated.	
			
			Labels:

				Top right label: show coordination of top right corner of the picture.,

				Label under “add 20 iterations” button: show coordination of the cursor.

		Numeric up downs:
			Size of window: automatically changes size of the window according to size of your screen.

	Color of background:

		Normal: shows random color for every iteration: 
	
		Shadowing: uses random colors with smooth transition: 
	
		One color change: smoothly changes color between main color and secondary color (if is that radio button checked button will appear): 

		Dark/Light: go from darker/lighter color to main color: 
		
		Darker: go between  main color and darker variant of that color in 15 color steps: 

		Negative: go between main color and its negative in 15 color steps:

		Professional: is like shadowing but you can chose all colors and color steps between them: 
	
	Color of set: each radio button sets color of the set to its value.

	Powers: sets in of formula z = z^n * c, first 5 are much faster to calculate, but the custom can have decimal places and even complex numbers.

	Saving: you can choose in what resolution you want to save your image.
	Options:
		Close: closes the application.
		Save picture: saves a picture that is on display right now.
		Ideas for Julia set: have good looking Julia sets.
		Dark/Light mode: changes app mode between light and dark mode.

		Save/Load position: saves/loads position in which are you white now.
		Zooming: to zoom you must click at some point and drag the mouse (red square will be drawn). And release.
		Changing to Julia set: you can use the mouse wheel click to pick a point to change the point as c in z = z^n * c Julia 			set formula.
